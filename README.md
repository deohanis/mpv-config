## Overview
Personal config files for mpv media player. This repo contains custom keybindings, pseudo GUI menu and various userscripts and shaders optimized for animated media as well as movies.

## Usage
Download the latest windows build of mpv from [here](https://mpv.io/installation/) and extract it. Download and copy `portable_config` folder from this repo to the extracted folder and you are good to go. Settings can be temporary changed using player menu and other adjustments can be done by editing `mpv.conf` and `input.conf`.

## Key Bindings
Custom key bindings can be added in `input.conf` file. Refer to the [manual](https://mpv.io/manual/master/) for making any changes. Default key bindings can be seen from the `input.conf` file or by pressing <kbd>o</kbd> and then <kbd>4</kbd> button, but most of the player functions can be used through the menu accessed by <kbd>Right Click</kbd>.

## System Requirement
This config was made for my current PC setup with RX 580 and 1080p 144Hz SDR screen, but can be used with low end integrated GPU like Intel HD Graphics 620 with limited functionality.
